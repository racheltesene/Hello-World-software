# Development Environment

### Tools Used to Develop the Software:
To develop the "Hello, World!" program, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE). VS Code provides features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging tools, making it easier to write and test Python code. I also used the Python extension within VS Code to execute the program directly from the editor.

### Programming Language Used:
The programming language used to create this software is Python. Python is a high-level, general-purpose language known for its simplicity and readability. Itâ€™s widely used in various fields like web development, data science, automation, and artificial intelligence. Python's easy-to-understand syntax makes it a great choice for beginners while being powerful enough for advanced applications.
